## üöÄ Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repository is configured for **automatic deployment** to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. Choose your preferred method:

### Method 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically deploys your site whenever you push changes to the main branch.

#### Setup Steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click "New repository" (green button)
   - Name your repository (e.g., `gatech-indian-community`)
   - Make sure it's set to "Public"
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Upload All Files**
   - In your new repository, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop **ALL** files from this project:
     - `index.html`
     - `style.css`
     - `script.js`
     - `README.md`
     - `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (the entire `.github` folder)
   - Add a commit message: "Initial website setup with GitHub Actions"
   - Click "Commit changes"

3. **Configure GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository **Settings** tab
   - Scroll to **Pages** section in left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select **"GitHub Actions"** (not "Deploy from a branch")
   - Click "Save"

4. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   - Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
   - If prompted, click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them"
   - The deployment should start automatically

5. **Access Your Live Site**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for the first deployment
   - Your site will be available at: `https://your-username.github.io/repository-name`
   - Check the **Actions** tab to see deployment status

#### How Automatic Deployment Works:

- ‚úÖ **Triggers**: Automatically deploys when you push to the main branch
- ‚úÖ **No Build Process**: Direct deployment of static files (HTML, CSS, JS)
- ‚úÖ **Asset Handling**: All images, fonts, and external resources are preserved
- ‚úÖ **Fast Deployment**: Typically takes 1-2 minutes
- ‚úÖ **Status Updates**: View deployment progress in the Actions tab

### Method 2: Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual deployment without GitHub Actions:

1. **Create Repository & Upload Files** (same as above, but skip the `.github` folder)
2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository **Settings** tab
   - Scroll to **Pages** section in left sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

### Method 3: Using Git (For developers)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd gatech-indian-simple

# Add your files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial website setup"
git push origin main

# The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your site
# Check the Actions tab for deployment status
```
